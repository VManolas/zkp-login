# üß™ Complete Flow Testing Guide

## Frontend is Running Successfully! ‚úÖ

**URL:** http://localhost:3000  
**Status:** Active and accessible  
**Process:** React development server running on port 3000

## üéØ Testing Checklist

### **Phase 1: Basic Frontend Load**
- [x] Frontend loads without errors
- [x] HTML structure is correct
- [x] JavaScript bundle loads successfully
- [x] No console errors on initial load

### **Phase 2: Wallet Connection**
- [ ] Connect MetaMask wallet
- [ ] Verify wallet connection success
- [ ] Check if user address is displayed
- [ ] Verify network is zkSync Era testnet

### **Phase 3: User Registration**
- [ ] Navigate to Registration tab
- [ ] Enter a test password
- [ ] Verify password strength indicator works
- [ ] Click "Register" button
- [ ] Verify Poseidon hash generation
- [ ] Check transaction success
- [ ] Verify user is marked as registered

### **Phase 4: Real ZK Proof Generation**
- [ ] Navigate to Login tab
- [ ] Enter the same password used for registration
- [ ] Click "Login" button
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Verify real ZK proof generation (not mock)
- [ ] Check proof generation progress indicators
- [ ] Verify proof is generated using actual circuit
- [ ] Check proof verification on-chain

### **Phase 5: Contract Interaction**
- [ ] Verify proof is sent to smart contract
- [ ] Check contract verification success
- [ ] Verify login success message
- [ ] Check user statistics update

### **Phase 6: Password Change**
- [ ] Navigate to Registration tab (should show password change)
- [ ] Enter new password
- [ ] Click "Change Password"
- [ ] Verify new hash is stored
- [ ] Test login with new password

### **Phase 7: Statistics Dashboard**
- [ ] Navigate to Statistics tab
- [ ] Verify user statistics are displayed
- [ ] Check global statistics
- [ ] Verify login attempts tracking

## üîç Key Things to Watch For

### **Real ZK Proof Generation:**
1. **Console Logs:** Look for snarkjs-related logs
2. **Proof Format:** Should see actual proof values (not mock hex strings)
3. **Generation Time:** Real proofs take longer than mock ones
4. **Circuit Files:** Should load WASM and zkey files from `/circuits/`

### **Poseidon Hash:**
1. **Hash Values:** Should be different from keccak256
2. **Consistency:** Same password should generate same hash
3. **Format:** Should be valid hex strings

### **Contract Interaction:**
1. **Proof Format:** Should match Groth16 format expected by contract
2. **Public Signals:** Should contain stored hash
3. **Verification:** Contract should successfully verify the proof

## üö® Common Issues to Check

### **Circuit Loading Issues:**
- Check browser console for 404 errors on circuit files
- Verify files exist in `/circuits/` directory
- Check CORS issues if any

### **Proof Generation Issues:**
- Look for snarkjs errors in console
- Check if WASM file loads correctly
- Verify zkey file is accessible

### **Contract Issues:**
- Check if contract addresses are correct
- Verify network connection
- Check gas estimation errors

## üìä Expected Performance

- **Proof Generation:** 2-5 seconds (real ZK proofs)
- **Hash Generation:** < 1 second
- **Contract Interaction:** 5-15 seconds (depending on network)
- **Total Login Flow:** 10-25 seconds

## üéâ Success Criteria

The test is successful if:
1. ‚úÖ Frontend loads without errors
2. ‚úÖ Wallet connects successfully
3. ‚úÖ User can register with password
4. ‚úÖ **Real ZK proof is generated** (not mock)
5. ‚úÖ Proof is verified on-chain
6. ‚úÖ Login succeeds with real ZK proof
7. ‚úÖ Password change works
8. ‚úÖ Statistics are tracked correctly

## üîß Debug Information

If issues occur, check:
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for failed requests
- Contract addresses in `contracts.json`
- Circuit files in `/circuits/` directory
- snarkjs library loading
